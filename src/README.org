#+TITLE: Implementation details

* Introduction

To run:
#+begin_example
generate-xml.sh
host-start.sh
host-stop.sh
#+end_example

The script =node-init.sh= is run on each node.


** deploy a local version
The project depends on python2, both interpreter and header
file. Thus, I'd better have a legacy environment to run it?

route oslrd and mgen. mgen should be from within the nodes?

host (no need generation):
- eventservice.xml
- otestpoint-broker.xml
