** refactor out into shim layer
*** what is shim layer exactly?

** multi-hop network
- multi-hop https://git.ece.iastate.edu/jlwahlig/CentralizedScheduler
- my fork https://git.ece.iastate.edu/hebi/CentralizedScheduler

** TODO plot get the right shape

The shape does not match exactly.

** DONE Running the emane tutorial demos
   CLOSED: [2019-10-25 Fri 15:54]

To run demo 0, I need few more packages for the olsrd viewer:

#+begin_example sh
apt install python-pycurl
# CAUTION: this will have stdin interaction
apt install python-tk
pip install pmw
#+end_example

Everything works. There is one error but probably not a big deal:

#+begin_example
ERROR EventService::open: Unable to set Real Time Priority
#+end_example

** DONE test privileged docker
   CLOSED: [2019-10-24 Thu 14:14]
Whehter LXC works inside such docker

** DONE Fix the PYTHONPATH problem
   CLOSED: [2019-10-25 Fri 10:47]
ubuntu/debian uses dist-packages for apt-installed python modules,
however, when using setup.py (as of emane), it seems to install in
site-packages, which is not in sys.path. Further, it seems that
.local/.../site-packages/ is added to sys.path somehow during pip
install, so is the sys.path updatable?

Solution: I'm going to install emane python manually.
** DONE run Zehua's VM
   CLOSED: [2019-10-25 Fri 15:52]

Start the visualizer:

#+begin_example
../scripts/olsrlinkview.py
#+end_example

Start the demo:

#+begin_example
demo-start
#+end_example

send tdma schedule:

#+begin_example
emaneevent-tdmaschedule -i emanenode0 schedule.xml 
#+end_example

Stop the demo:

#+begin_example
./demo-stop
#+end_example

Set SUDO_USER env variable so that the persist/xxx is under my user, easier for debugging.

*** CANCELED GUI testing workflow

** DONE deploy a local version

*** understand the workflow
*** emane node script debugging
I need a way to more efficiently debug the mgen_fifo.py script.


** Debug whole process
*** DONE try original mgen
    CLOSED: [2019-10-27 Sun 01:18]
Mostly just test the start and stop script, and the logging.

*** DONE try mgen fifo
    CLOSED: [2019-10-28 Mon 07:58]
I'll need a better debugging strategy for script running inside the node.

** DONE deploy a local version
   CLOSED: [2019-10-26 Sat 16:48]
The project depends on python2, both interpreter and header
file. Thus, I'd better have a legacy environment to run it?

*** DONE host topology create & removal
    CLOSED: [2019-10-26 Sat 15:32]
deploy a topology of LXC VMs
*** DONE VM init scripts
    CLOSED: [2019-10-26 Sat 15:32]
run emane instance on host? Connect VMs to emane via networking setting
*** DONE platform xml generation
    CLOSED: [2019-10-26 Sat 16:40]
route oslrd and mgen. mgen should be from within the nodes?

host (no need generation):
- eventservice.xml
- otestpoint-broker.xml

node:
- platform$nodeId.xml
- eventdaemon$nodeId.xml
- otestpoint-recorder$nodeId.xml
- otestpointd$nodeId.xml

schedules are not generated.

*** DONE mgen scripts
    CLOSED: [2019-10-26 Sat 16:47]
** DONE stablize live plotter
   CLOSED: [2019-10-28 Mon 09:15]
** DONE FIXME why olsr is not printing out configs
   CLOSED: [2019-10-28 Mon 15:54]
*** DONE mgen pipe error
    CLOSED: [2019-10-28 Mon 14:55]

This is because olsrd is not started correctly (conf path bug).
